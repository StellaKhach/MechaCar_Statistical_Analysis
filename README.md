From the outcome above we see that the data seems to fit in normally. The minimum is -19.4702 and the max is 18.5849. We also see that the median is -0.0697 which is almost perfectly inbetween the min and max.

1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
   For this,we reference the P-Value and see that it is within the 95%. Meaning that it is below 0.05 significance.
   
2. Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  To answer this we reference the formula used for MPG. As we can take a look at the coefficients output 
  and notice that the outcome is not 0. 
  
3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  We can look at the r squared value and see that it's at .7149. This would indicate a strong correlation and          result in a rather effective method.
